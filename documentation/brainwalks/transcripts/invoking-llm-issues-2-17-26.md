I think I know from the jump, uh, before I get into testing, is that, at the beginning of a stage, which the only one I've seen so far is the invoking stage. Um, The LLM should be providing the 1st message. Um, two, he does not seem to be remembering the things that I'm saying. So, I told him kind of what my one of my adventure to be, and then he said, okay, great, what do you want the adventure to be? And, uh, I, I, well, like the thing I just said, and then when I did that, He Said, okay, well, tell me more, and he asked, like, kind of more questions or whatever. And it was just, for me, it was just a little too much. Other people might be great. or other users. And so I, um, So I said, you know, I want to keep, I want to move on to attunement. And even though you made a fix to look for it, again, he was like, I can't do that. And then when that happened, then he forgot again. So he's not leading with a message, which he should be. He's not picking up that I'm saying, hey, I want to go onto a tombet. Um, he's not updating the panel. With my spark. Um, And He seems to be forgetting what I'm saying.
