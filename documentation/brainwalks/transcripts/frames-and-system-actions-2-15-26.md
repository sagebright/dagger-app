Okay, so backing up. So this is a brainwalk about... the Book of Minipaths. And I think. So, I have a concept error that we need to address, and this has implications at the database level. I'll talk about that first. I thought... that the... I thought that a frame was like a world that an adventure was taking place in. And within a frame, there is a setting. So, you could have a frame of 2026 United States. But then you can have a setting in Minneapolis. Or Washington, DC. And those would be very different. Adventures, but they would be put in a backdrop of United States 2026. That's what I thought was the case. Um... But it's not. And so I want to back up and talk about just at a high level. Hi, y'all. Talk about a high level what? Uh, the categories actually are. So, Daggerhart has three categories. that apply here. Uh, potentially apply here. Those are locations. Frames. And environments. These are... little squishy. For our purposes, we will be using... something like environments. Something between a frame and an environment. You know what? Let's just call it a frame. We're going to be using frames. We won't use environments, we won't use locations. Frames and frames only. I want to talk about, practically speaking, what that's gonna look like after I describe the three. And then, I'm gonna talk about where there are places to apply the other two. Um, and then talk about database implications. So for Daggerhart, again, we're only considering frames here, but they have locations and a location is... something closer to... a world. So, a campaign brain can exist within a location. It doesn't have to. So location's sort of optional. But think of a location as, like, a world. And it can have, you know, many towns, many factions, many creatures, um, it's the closest thing. It's the closest thing to, like, a D&D, um, source book, like a, the sword coast source book or the Raven Loft source book. where it's talking about a geographic area and all the things associated with it. That's what a location is. So we don't need that. for this yet. When we expand to beyond single one shot adventures to campaigns, locations will become much more important. From a database standpoint, we don't have a concept of locations in our database. And we need one. Because even though we're not using them now, we need to note that it's there, and we need to have all of the appropriate fields. And we actually need to start populating it. for future consideration. But as a first step, we need to add a dagger heart underscore locations table. We need to gather the properties that are associated with locations. Some of them will be required a lot of them won't, and the ones that, and some of them will have multiple injuries, right? So, locations can have many of towns and many, you know, like, that kind of thing, right? So, we need to take care of that. A settings, I'll describe that next, before I get to frames. Setting is on the other end of that. Sorry, I set a setting. I meant an environment. An environment is on the other end of that spectrum with a big twist. Um... And this is where I'm pausing, because I... I don't know if... environments, I don't know if we're gonna use them or not. Because here's what they are. They would be something like a point of interest. So think a tavern. Think... a... and by the way, that tavern, which is an environment, could be in a town that is part of a location. So, an environment can, but does not have to belong to a location. An environment is like a... Yeah, so like it's a tavern. It a point of interest, right? So it's a, Monastery. It's a castle. It's a forest. The kind of places where, like, a one shot of venture would take place, which is why I'm a little hesitant to say we're not gonna use it. Um... What was interesting about environments is that they are assigned tears. And environments have certain properties that... the players will have to interact with and kind of account for. such that the environment itself, uh, can serve as an adversary of the players. So, for example, um... I mean, kind of a high level slang way to say it, is that environments will have a vibe that has real world, or in game effects. So, for example, an environment is going to have certain adversaries that are common. But it's also going to have... an attitude or a disposition toward the players that can impact those typical adversaries. So a simple example would be something like, you know, you have an adversary that is typically neutral and won't attack unless it's attacked. But if you put it inside an environment that is a, you know, mansion of an evil warlock, then maybe that changes. Um, And then the counter could be as well. You could have something that typically attacks on site, making, like, a red cap in D&D. But it might be an environment that is actually very hospitable to the players, and so it sort of changes. So the environments have dispositions that color how NPCs and adversaries interact with the players. And again, those are the kinds of things that can be, like, one shot territory. And probably would work for this. Probably would. But... I want to use frames instead. And the reason I do, um, so a location can have many environments, or it will have any environments, a location can have many campaign frames. Now, the design and intent of a campaign frame. is exactly what it says. It's designed to create a framework for a fuller campaign. Not a one shot. And so because of that, the properties of a frame are... a little, um... like, definitionally, they're, like, a little bigger than what a one shot would be. And by that, I mean, they have properties like, there's an overview, there's a backstory, you know, Civil War has broken out in this area. Uh, so something is active, right, as opposed to a location that, you know, that area is a part of location, and there's not always civil war. So, like, you know, sometimes it really doesn't, um, you know, it's not set up for a campaign frame, because there's nothing going on, but then a civil war pops off, and boom, now you have opportunity for campaign frames in that area. So, it has, like, an overview of something that's happened, uh, kind of backstory. It talks about, or a frame has, typical adversaries, like you would see in an environment. Um, it has, uh, NPCs. It has factions, and that's where it steps off a little bit from the environments, because the environments are a large, they're small. So they don't have, necessarily have factions, right? They don't necessarily have, just the stakes are bigger, the scope is bigger with a campaign frame. The reason I want to keep it is because it has properties that aren't required, but could be desired. So... um... maybe somebody doesn't want factions, that's okay. They don't have to use them. But I'd rather have them available to them if they do. Um.. Fact, or, I'm sorry, campaign frames also have... inciting incidents. And this is where I think we have... where we tie in, what, what Bikini Pass is doing, and I think we can, we can do some really nice things with the exciting incident, because you have this overview, I chose the Civil War example, right? So you have that. As an overview, a backdrop. But then, the inciting incident is that, you know, the warring group in the Civil War has invaded this town. And so it's not just that there's a civil war going on, it's that there is, you know, something that's happening, like, right here, that is, um, problematic. And so, um, yeah, so that's kind of what we're looking at in terms of why we would still want to use a campaign frame. Now, there might be properties of campaign frame. that we're not super interested in, in sort of displaying. So, like, a campaign frame has a complexity. And that's gonna be tied to something like, um, you know, how much moral ambiguity is there? Um, how many factions do you have running around? How much like tension are you stepping into? And how many, you know, what kind of potential complications could there be? So complexity is more of like, you know, how much work is this gonna be for the GM? And how many different muscle sets is you gonna have to flex, but then also, how much are the players gonna have to think about this? So, you know, low complexity campaign frame would be something like, you know, Civil War. Maybe that's not a good example, 'cause civil war comes up to the complexity, but, um, the campaign frame is something like a long, dormant, um, you know, evil spirit or something, has come out of hiding from its dungeon, then it's sending zombies in to, like, try to, you know, kill people at night or something like that. In that case, what you would have is like, Hey, your job is to go into the inciting incident, is that, you know, starting coming out of this... dungeon, and so that's sort of the exciting, the background is the, I guess the background would be, the evil sphere was locked away for 500 years. And it recently broke out. That's the background, the inciting incident is that, when these zombies have been increasingly attacking people, and they attacked and abducted, did not kill, as best they could tell, but abducted the mayor's daughter, or the mayor. And so, that's the inciting incident. And in that case, complexity would be pretty low, 'cause all you're doing here is going into a dungeon, snatching grab, grab. Lets get out of here, and then there's opportunity also to banish the spirit again. So the complexity on that would be low compared to... Curse of Straud. It's gonna have all of these. factions, some of which are just as unclear whose side are they on, or is there a side? Um, I mean, maybe we want that property, maybe we don't. I think we want to store the database, whether or not we display its feather, another situation. But my point is, the frames will be more flexible for us. And so, I want to start with that. There are also the thing that Dagger Hart has is, like, the most, um... sort of, like, it's a prominent concept, more so than locations or environments. Um... So... So it's frames. Um... So there's kind of two things going on here, though. His frames are... So, the intent to book many paths is that if you start, if you say, like, I want an adventure like this, um, that you got some flexibility. Like, we're not just pulling something out of the database, right? We're making something on the fly. And I think the general principle I want to operate from here is... I want to be capable of... creating frames on the fly. And that can look like, um... can look like two things. One, maybe it's not creating, maybe we have, you know, a hundred different frames in the database, and maybe they're just pulling a stock one. Um, that's a possibility. And so when you're giving somebody the choice of frames at the beginning, you're pulling from stock. But because the frame ends up, like, that is the adventure, right? Like, we're gonna build from the frame. Um, because of that exciting incident. So it's not the case that we're going to ask the user what kind of thing they want to do. We gonna pull a frame that's sort of like that same vibe, but then we're gonna, like, chop the frame up into different pieces and really expand upon it. That's not what we're gonna do. We are gonna present, they're gonna tell us, like, here's kind of what I'm interested in. We are going to present them with three frames that come approximate that, including the inciting incident, which is the Genesis for the adventure. It's kind of fitting that vibe. So, depending on what they say, there's a very strong likelihood, and I should say, the fact that the frame has an inciting incident, um, creates a constraint on adventure generation. So if somebody says, I want, you know, something, and it really isn't a good match, then the system is gonna have to generate a new frame on the fly. And it is going to say that, if it generates a frame on the fly, it is going to save it. Any frame, which means it can be creating a whole bunch of frames that never get used. So if the user comes to, you know, comes to the frame selection part, oh, gosh, no, I forgot, binding part, and says, hey, I don't like any of these frames, and they were all ones that would pull from the database. Um, give me 3 more, if you keep doing that, you're gonna, like, you're gonna have, it's gonna eventually produce 3 that it's never, that's just crazy on the fly. And they're gonna select one, and it's gonna have two that it's created, 'cause it's filled in all the properties. that don't get selected. Still want to save those. Um, it's also the case that the system might be able to mix and match some of these. So it may be the case that if they, if two frames share certain properties, then either those properties, or, I guess, they share certain properties, that might enable them to be able to swap properties. So, uh, that aren't the same. So, for example, if they share the property of being, um, like kind of horror themed, right? Uh, then maybe it's the case that they have very different, um, I don't know, adversaries, typical adversaries, right? Um, it might be the case that the system says, Well, look, I've got these two frames that are pretty similar. I'm gonna swap out... these two pieces. and see if the user might like that. So you could probably mix and match it. I kind of wanna understand how transferable some of these properties are. If they have properties X, properties X, you know, which ones can, uh, from properties that Y can be interchanged. Um, so maybe something like that. don't know. But I think the takeaway is they need to be able to create them on the fly, then you'd be able to save everything. And when they save something that they themselves created, uh, there needs to be a, each frame should have a property. It does not exist in our frame state right now, but each frame should have a property of... I guess, like, how it was generated, because if we're generating them in ways that involve human interaction, human guidance. And by the way, we need to... This is a side note or an action step, we need to create a process for creating frames. Uh, and evaluation techniques for those, because I recognize now we're going to create a whole bunch of them. If they're done with the human assistance or collaboration, I should say. those have kind of passed human inspection and been, like, kind of approved for general distribution. Ones that get created on the fly, chosen or not, I want to save them, but I want to flag them, such as, you know, generated on a fly or whatever. such that the admins can go back in and review those, and potentially approve them for, uh, kind of a permanent roster spot. Um.. So, that's what we want to say about frames. I also recognize, and we've talked about locations, that we need a new table for that, and research properties and all that kind of stuff. And we know we need at least new one new table for frames, how it's generated. Or one new column at a table. How friends are generated. Um... But we also want to do some work. On environment. Now, we're not gonna use those immediately. Necessarily. But. Well, I say that, actually, now that I think about it, um, I don't think that's right. I think we would be wise to use environments. Let me think about this for a minute. I'll start with what I know. What I know is that we need a more substantive database for environments. And I know that we have a sufficient number in the database already. to... to extract, abstract away from properties and, uh, build our own. So, in the same way that we need a campaign frame, creation workflow, we also need a workflow for, um, environment creation. I also want to inspect... I also wanna have a conversation about how... Nah, I'm gonna hang off on that program. It's fine. Um, So we need workflop for creating this. Because, just like with locations, we will have... full campaign administration. Within the Book of Many paths, and we're gonna want environments at that point. I think at this point, all we need to do is create many environments. Like hundreds of them. I think we have, like, 10 or 15 right now. And the reason I want to create so many... is because... they are fantastic drop ins. Four one shots or full campaigns. So imagine having environments for a tavern, for an inn, for a blacksmith shop, for a general goods store. You have all of these environments that are, that make up a town. And you can create new towns by stringing together many environments. You could also have a one shot that starts in a tavern, and ends in a forest. Um... And so, in that case, you could have two existing environments, right, that we've already created. What makes me think... that when an adventure is created... There needs to be a cleanup step or set of cleanup steps to evaluate whether what other things, what all was generated on fly. that needs to be captured in the database, in either with states or in tables, that indicate a review stage, so that a human can come back in and say, hey, I like what you did with this adversary that you created. By the way, we don't have adversary creation right now, but that's coming very quickly. Um... Or the system's not gonna generate a lot of means, but we'll give them the ability to do that. Uh, or I like the NBC you created, they will be creating NBCs. And so, um, I want to save all those. In the same way, frames, I want to say frames. Um, and, you know, I want to say settings. So there is gonna need to be this pretty heavy lifting where there are workflows that run in the background of adventure generation, such as an adventure is done, all the things that were created in the course of that adventure creation are appropriately stored in a database for human review at later time. So... Yeah, so they are going to be creating environments. Probably a lot of them, because when the system gets to... the stage of... Um, and now I forget what it's called, but where it's actually creating the, you know, the overarching, um, adventure. It's gonna be based on the inciting incident. There are gonna be saying things like, this is gonna start in a tavern, go to a forest, and then you have to go back to the tavern or whatever. And so, it's going to reference things that... whether it grabs them from the database of grief and apply are going to be environments. And if it's gonna say it starts in the tavern, I would much prefer it to create, go to the trouble of creating a new tavern. It was the one that it has doesn't, you know, exactly fit. Um, I would rather go through and create all the things associated with it. So that we would then... So it's creating an asset as we go along. This is a side note and a pretty important one, I think. I've been trying to figure out how to do this with cost consciousness in mind. of not asking the database or the, especially the LLM. to do too much work, just from a cost standpoint. And that's been an unwise approach, because I've done that without researching, well, how much does it cost? And so... I realized, like, each call is, like, not much at all. Um, that's hundreds of a penny or something. So... the difference between a cheap session, which maybe is, you know, a dime or a quarter versus a heavy session, that's maybe a dollar. Um, like, the cost of the actual raw cost differentials so low. Um, that what I want to do in terms of architectural approach is, I do not want to have cost constraints as a factor. I don't want to try to limit what we're asking the LLM to do from a cost consciousness standpoint. And I want to build it to be as badass as possible. And then we can evaluate what the cost is, and then if we need to make it a little less badass, we can tweak it in certain ways. But, um, I guess what it comes down to is I just didn't realize it's just so cheap. Um, so... I do want to make that note. So in terms of architectural decisions, we are gonna do that. And currently, I have an open AI API key. Um, I would strongly prefer to use Anthropic. And so I need some guidance on how I get my anthropic API key. I probably, you know, have access to something where I can generate one already, but I doubt that I already have one. Um, so I need some guidance on that. Okay, so that's actually, I said that was a side note, but it's a really nice segue into what I'm gonna say next. Or is coming. So I'm on the binding page, right? We're selecting Frame. When a user does that, they are selecting, you know, the inclusion of an inciting incident. And, like, that's the thing that's gonna, you know, kick this thing off. So they don't have a little bit of a taste of what is to come. That's almost the adventure overview at that point. The actual adventure overview is just gonna be one extra layer of granularity. So, what this means from a UI standpoint is that a user's gonna see three frame options. They're gonna click a frame, and it will show them full details. All the properties, inciting incident overview factions, all that kind of stuff, to whatever degree they exist for that brain. Um, They... need to So this is interesting. I think we want the user to look at the details. We would expect them to. I think we would want them to. And the only case in which we wouldn't want them to is if they've seen, they've seen it before. They've played that frame or whatever. Um... But in that case, we're costing them just one click, and... there's a good chance they don't click on the first place, 'cause they recognize it. So they're gonna click everybody, you're gonna click the frame. I definitely think we want to make them do it because I want them to see the inciting incident. Right now, inciting incidents since lower on the page, we need to make that much more prominent, probably overview and inciting incident. Hell, maybe we lead with the inciting incident. Um, but that becomes a... We need to put the most important decision making information in front of the GM at the top. Um, and so, like, complexity goes to the very bottom of that list, assuming we keep it, which would probably do. Um.. Once they see that... just clicking back, what happens when they click back? Um... I feel like there needs to, man, this is, I don't love this because... I don't know what kind of implications this is gonna have for other pages. But I feel like we want a button. I don't think we want him to click back. I feel like we want... a button that says confirmed frame. And on confirmed frame click, when they come, the binding page shows that one as highlighted. If they click back to frames, that choice is not highlighted. It's all turned off. Nobody's highlighted. The only one that's highlighted is the one for which I have clicked. Confirm frame. That's not how a tune works. You just click, and... then you have to hit back, and I'm wondering, that's just a bad idea. Maybe it's the case that we do need to confirm selection thing in attunement. Maybe we do it. I just forgotten. So we want to confirm frame button. It needs to be at the top, not the bottom. Mm, we got other buttons at the bottom. It needs to be at the bottom. Which means we have a real estate issue, because if you, that's gonna be tricky, because if you... Uncollapse everything in a frame. You're not gonna be able to see the confirmed frame button. So maybe we need that. I do want to keep it at the bottom to be consistent with other pages. But I'm wondering if it needs to float so that it never leaves the user's vision. I think that's, I think that's what we have to do. Because there's gonna be so much variability on that screen. based on the user. Collapsing and uncollapsing things. Um... And if we do that, we're done with binding. Now. That's what we need to do from a UI standpoint. And I like that. Especially if the floating bottom button can be executed well. I don't really know what that's gonna look like. But that's, we absolutely need to figure out some way to have a button at the bottom of the screen that does not escape the user's vision. Like, well, whatever the heck we have to do to do that. And if there's just simply no way, then we're... I would prefer to put a button at the top. Otherwise, they're gonna be chasing that button at the bottom. I don't like that. Okay. Um, but this presents a problem. It presents a good news, bad news thing. So... Two issues and a benefit. Um, one of the issues is... when a user is, well, I guess it's actually a question. The user sees the frame, and they're like, I... like it, but I want to kind of... adjust it some. So instead of it being, you know, civil war, I want it to be resurrected zombies, who are still fighting on behalf of the side who lost that side. Okay, that's, yeah, that's a pretty big change. Um, That would be the signal. So, so the... The LLM at that point needs to... make that edit and regenerate any of the other properties that are associated with that edit. Which is gonna depend. I don't really know what to say about that yet. I would want to keep that to a minimum. Um, maybe not. What the hell do I know? Um, so they're gonna, they, they want to, they definitely want to comply with user request to make an edit. That is going to absolutely kick off saving a new frame. Um... That's going to entail having a different name for the frame. So the LLM is gonna have to have a strategy on, um, like, it's gonna need to look and see, like, does, is the name, does the name still work? Um, like the name of the frame. And the user might want to rename it. Whatever. But I kind of think the name may not change. The default may leave the name alone, just change some minor detail, right? So, it doesn't want to tell the user, hey, I need to store this in a database under a different name. Can we name this something different? Best thing will work. So what it'll have to do is save something in a database. I suppose it could... Yeah, I could, I suppose that a name is not unique. So, yeah, it's just not unique. That's easy. Um, but it's gonna have certain other properties. And because it's going to have this human review piece to it, yeah, user can catch that there's needs derivative name. Okay, uh, so, uh, user's request to tweak an existing frame. We'll set off the workflow for the system to create a new frame. And there may be some iterations, some edits, back and forth, on the frame, and the LLM simply needs to, or the system needs to save the one that got confirmed. I don't want to say, I don't want to say 15 edits. You would just save the one that was confirmed. Um... So that's not too hard. That's not too hard. But that is that's a thing. Um, as opposed to the past, where frames were static and could not change. Which is probably the way the documentation reads now. Okay. Um... So now... What's the other problem that happens? Well, one of the benefit, I'll say this, the benefit is the inclusion of the inciting incident. Because once they have selected that, it makes it much more likely that the initial pitch on the adventure will be accepted. And by accepted, I mean, like, on target. Uh, that's a better way to say it. Um... Because, up to this point, all we've had, like, we haven't had that level of specificity, so I really, really like that. That'll make the process feel a lot more immersive, frankly. I love that. But one of the other things that it brings up... is, I think this makes the first page, the invocation page. A little dicier. Now, the page works visually. The diciness, I think, comes in. When you consider what the system actions are, which is not something I've really talked about, and what we're trying to get out of that first page is a vibe of what they're looking for. And for that to be agreed upon. So agreed upon vibe, big or small. And a name. And I, oh, and name's optional. And I think that is asking that page. It's asking the user to do too much. Um. I think it is valuable. So, here's what I see that page doing. I don't think anything needs to change visually on the page. This is user action, purpose, of the page, that kind of thing. If we ask the user to give us, like, what they're looking for... That's valuable, and the LLM doesn't even have to do anything other than just, like, confirm understanding. It probably doesn't need to do anything beyond that. So, confirms understanding in, like, a compelling way, right? Like, I got you. I understand what you're trying to do way. Um... And then that can constrain their campaign frames that they present and or create. That's gonna be a signal to them of what they are gonna be displaying on the binding page. So whatever information they get, I think all we want is confirmation from the LLM. Or this is what I heard you say, and then the user's like, Yeah, cool. And then when the user was like, Yeah, that's what I'm shooting for. That, then, becomes the signal to move to the next stage. Um, and that'll be displayed over in the sidebar, right? Um... But I think it would also be valuable. Well, it's gonna impact binding, but it's also gonna impact. attunement, because if they say it, you know, I don't really know, but I want, you know, something that kind of feels like this book. Or whatever. Uh, which I think would be a common... way that the LLM draws it out of them. Um... I don't think I wanna do this. What I was gonna say is that the yellow M could feed certain details that the user would give them. To attunement. So, for example, if I said, Hey, I'm looking for a one shot for my group, do we want the invocation page? I think we want the invocation page to say, okay, cool, you'll be able to put all that in entertainment. Right now, I'm just, like, that's cool. You want me to lock that down just a second? Um, do you have any guidance on, like, what you want, the feeling to be? Um, I think the alternative is that if we, if the LLM, we don't want the LLM to, we, no, we either want the LLM to prepopulate the attoonment page with things they've told us on invocation, or we, on the invocation page, we need to make sure that they don't make that promise or send that signal, that's what they're doing. Um, one of those 2 things need to happen. It would be amazing if they free populated, but it would need to be, um, I don't know how much a lip that is. Okay. The amazing visit, though. So, um... that actually would be amazing. Tell us what to do now, and then we'll set up for you. Okay. And it's only gonna apply to a tomb in life. Um, I think the name is... Somewhere, I think it's a fool's errand. Most people aren't gonna know. Um... And I don't think. I don't think we even bring it up. I think a name emerges. And... I think it might be as simple. As on the ceiling page, on the ceiling page, it says, hey, based on everything, maybe not, maybe not the ceiling page, maybe on the... Okay, this is what needs to happen. A name needs to emerge organically. It needs to be suggested by the system. The user needs... the freedom to change it or to ask for more suggestions or options. And when that is agreed upon, so LLM surfaces it, LLM makes suggestions, user can edit or ask for more options. And also, when there is a selection agreed upon... then that replaces whatever placeholder name. We've had in the header bar. So, headerbar behavior is gonna change because of that name. And from the jump, there needs to be a placeholder name when you get to Attunement. So whatever invocation won't have it, or it'll be hidden by default. And if by some miracle, the user has a name. Hell, I think it's just populated on the next page. I don't know, whatever. Um, but there's gonna be a placeholder name on the attunement page. And... at that point, it can just be stocked. It could be username, um, new adventure, you know, whatever. Something with a little bit of pizzazz, but, like... it's not untitled, right? But it's clearly, it's placeholding. Okay. It also has a placeholder name. Um... Hmm... Okay, so it's gonna show up first on attunement, as a placeholder name. We are gonna surface the name... as a part of, or, or on approval of... the... I think it's the, is it the weaving page? It's the one that gives the high level description of the adventure and the scenes. Whatever that thing is, we haven't, like, mapped out everything, but we do know, like, the general arc of each scene. That's when a name makes sense, to be suggested. Makes sense for... the agent to be able to come up with it. And so... I think the move there, and again, these are, like, system actions. is that when a user, when there's confirmation that the user is cool with... the overall adventure. Whether that's weaving or the step ahead of it, I'm not sure. Um... Then... The user's already, the user has control, right? So the user is gonna click, continue, to whatever the page is. Uh, oh, it's in scripture. think it's inscription. You weave, and then you inscribe. So... When they are headed to inscription, they're gonna click the button 'cause they're satisfied. And they're satisfied because they've signed off on it. Oh, I just think it's another, like, piece of the thing that they sign off on. is the name. So they're signing off on the high level, and they can, you know, go back and forth with the LLM on details of the scene or whatever, but, um... Yeah, the name is part of that. And, and so, when they, if the, if the continue to inscribing button is active, um, they've already chosen a name. Okay. And at any point, the system won't prompt them for this, but at any point, they want to change the name, they can. Um, Do we want that? You know, I don't think we want that, because we're locking all the other things. And so when somebody wants to go back and change something, So typically, if somebody wants to go back and change something, Man, I'm off on a rabbit trail here, but, like, what can they... change? And when can they not change anymore? I think the simplest path... is is they can't go back. And if they ask to go back, I think the very simple way to do it is for the... LLM to say, unfortunately, we can't go backwards. However, you're gonna receive these documents, you know, as a word, Doc, or a martin out file, or whatever. And you can make the changes, you know, it's yours. So, yeah, so I don't think we facilitate being able to go backwards in the process. Because the danger of doing that is if you go back to a tune and change the tier level, right? then it's gonna reset everything. Um, and... they kind of need to be sure about that. And maybe there's some prompts that the LLM can give, you know, reminders, that those things are locked. Okay, but we surfaced the name then, so then I went down that rabbit trail because I was thinking, like, do we want to let them change the name late? I think we don't. I think once they locked the name in, they locked the name in. But... the LLM can certainly suggest new ones. Um, and then they can make those changes manually themselves to the end. Um. Okay. So, now what? Um... So, the question service is there. in weaving. Of the name. And then inscribing... is all the details. And one thing of note, on a number of these... So, again, we're talking user actions. Our system actions here. On a number of these pages, there is going to be the opportunity for collaboration. Really, probably a tomb is the only one. It's not. But there's gonna be collaboration. So they want to change something about a frame. They want to change something about a weaving. They want to change something, or the one change something about the binding. They want to change something in weaving, they want to change something in inscribing, um... I think they can't change past that because... we have. Let me think about this. Once we've inscribed... we could technically skip everything else. 'Cause it's all there in the text. Not the echoes, but, like, those are not, those are generated without, uh, user input anyway. Um, not echoes crying. We need a name for what those are. Um... Portent, perhaps, I don't know. Um... But they know who all the NPCs are gonna be, that know what the creatures are gonna be. They don't have their stat blocks. And so... If we wanted to. we could remove... if we wanted to. We could remove. Um... conjuring, summoning, enchanting, and scrying. We did that, we would include that documentation, stat blogs, and all that kind of stuff. In the ceiling step. But we would not, we wouldn't be giving users. We're not wanting to give users choice on scrying anyway. But we would not, if they wanted to make changes to any of that stuff, they would have to make it... at the inscribing level. We could do that. I don't want to do that. But... I'm not clear on how much latitude. Well, they can't have unfettered latitude to make changes. to NPC's adversaries. Items. Because if they do, they start jacking with game balance. So I think that... you could probably change the... names? of the NPCs. And maybe you can change, like, ancestry and... or, I'm sorry, species and maybe class. I don't know. But you couldn't change, like... an NPC's relationship. They're the mayor. We couldn't change our their role. You couldn't change their role. You couldn't change, um... But the information that they carry... And you probably could. I just don't want to mess with it. That just, come on. That seems too over the top. To say, like, Oh, I want this other person to carry that information. Again, they can chop it up however they want on their own. Um... But they could change in NPC's name. Hmm. But maybe not. Okay. I guess what I'm getting at is... I want... their approval at the conjuring, summoning, and enchanting phases. Because it's very easy. to... Like, miss those. Just in the walls of text. So, okay, okay, okay. What if we did this? What if...? What if, at the inscribing stage... We... We had the inscribing stage tabbed. So right now, you have items, right? And items are, can be weapons or artifacts or consumables or whatever. What if we did something similar? So, so, I don't think it's a bad thing if we just said, Here, your NPC used to be all knocking, we can change them. Same with items, whatever. Like, we could get away with that, but I don't, I don't like the way that feels. I want them to I want them to connect with these NPCs and adversaries and items. in the creation process. This is the problem I'm trying to solve. I want them to feel connected to those things. Just crying, too, for that matter, I suppose. But the time where it matters the most for them to have collaborative ability. is... before they actually see them. And once they actually see them, if they want to start messing with them, it kind of affects everything, it could affect everything else. And that doesn't feel good. So I want to... And my assumption is, in most cases, they're going to... approve... NPC's adversaries and items. Like, pretty much gonna appreciate it. Like, you're gonna have them say, like, Eh. You know, I want to make this a little tougher. Let's have three of those adversaries instead of four, or so two, or, you know, I want to change a name, or class, or a species, or... It's not gonna be, like, wholesale things that they're gonna want to change. It's probably just approving. But I do see it, like, I do like the idea of having everything on one screen, and, man, that's gonna be... some fricking work on that screen, though. Because they will be approving the story and the NPCs, and the items, and the adversaries all... together. But I do like that the workflow is a lot shorter. Oh, what do we do this? They're gonna click on a scene. They're gonna see content. And maybe, at that, they have, once they click a scene, they have tabs for... narrative, which is gonna have, like, everything. At least like an NBC name, right? Um... But you're also gonna have a tab for... NPCs... and adversaries. If you click on those tabs, the left panel shows basically what it shows. on the those other screens now. Um, probably gonna have to show their full stat block, rather than, 'cause you wouldn't click into it again. I don't think. That's pretty nested. Okay, so they've clicked on scene one. They seen the narrative content. Um... They click on NPCs, tab, in scene one. I see the NPC card. But there's more to it than that. So. Do they have collapsible sections underneath? And we just put all the MPCs on there, but they've got these collapsible sections, or... can they click on an NPC card? And it goes another layer deeper to say more about the NPC. And this whole time, the LLM can make edits and changes. So do we display at all, or do we allow another layer of nesting? All right, so that's problem one. I'm trying to do that. Um, problem two would be, what do we do with items? Because it's already tabbed. Maybe thinking about this the wrong way. What if...? What if they are approving, like, at the description stage, inscribing? What if they are approving the narrative? They still go, and that's what they're doing. So it stays largely as it is right now. And so you'd have NPCs that would be referenced. Yeah, I think that's it. I think... Okay, I'm gonna back way up and just say we're doing it the right way. They are functionally approving the narrative. at that point at the inscribing stage. And so if they say something like, you know, Can I make the... Did they say something, like, Can I get different adversaries or whatever? They can do it on the spot, right? But... I do think they would, on the NPC, a conjuring page. Yeah, I think they can make whatever changes that they wanted, but the LLM needs to be sophisticated enough to say, I could, I can do that. But, you know, it bumps this up to a harder fight or something like that, right? So it'll do whatever you want it to do. And it'll make the appropriate change in the narrative, which won't be that significant, right? So it would just be, oh, these aren't goblins, they're orcs. Um, Yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I just, I think, so what we're doing there, they're approving the narrative and inscribing, and then they are approving the MPCs, and they can pretty much change anything as long as it doesn't, um, step outside the bounds of what they have already committed to. upstream from that, in attunement and whatever. Um, Yeah, we're doing it the right way. So they approve the narrative. They can make changes to things that would impact downstream stuff that's cool. Um, if they wanted to change the name of an NPC, then whenever I went to the next page, that would be changed. That's cool. No problem. Um, Yeah, I think that's it. I think I talked in a big old circle on that last part.
